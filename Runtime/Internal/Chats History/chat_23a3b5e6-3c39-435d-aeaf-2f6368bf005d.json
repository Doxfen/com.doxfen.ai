Name it `BasicMovement` (matching the class name).\n2.  **Copy Code:** Open the newly created `BasicMovement` script and replace its contents with the code provided above. Save the file.\n3.  **Attach to GameObject:** Select a 3D object in your scene (e.g., a Cube or Sphere). In the Inspector window, click `Add Component` and search for \"BasicMovement\" or drag the `BasicMovement` script from the Project window onto the GameObject.\n4.  **Run Scene:** Play your scene. The GameObject with the attached script will start moving forward. You can adjust the `Speed` property directly in the Inspector while the game is running to see its effect."
